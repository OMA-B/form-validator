# form-validator

This is quite some project to build my knowledge on how to:

~ make an nice form UI

~ make cool and smooth animation effects, with video implentation

~ manipulate the DOM to improve interactivity, especially with the form input elements

~ make field a must to be filled

~ add patterns of how a user should fill the form

~ check input validity using JS

~ check if a url filled is valid globally

~ get user data using HTML input `name` attribute.

and so many more
